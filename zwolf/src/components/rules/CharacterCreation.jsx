            <h2>Character Creation</h2>
            <p>The following steps are used to craft a character's statistics in Z-Wolf. Note that many special abilities have other special abilities as prerequisites, meaning that you have to kind of build a character level-by-level, even if the character is going to start the game at a higher level than 1.</p>
            <h3>1. Basics</h3>
            <p>Ask your GM what level your character will start the game at. Then, decide ahead of time what sort of concept you have in mind for your character; making all these choices will be much easier if you have some direction. It would be good to come up with a very short Epithet describing them, such as "mage" or "thug."</p>
            <p>Levels 1-4 are where ordinary non-adventuring folk are found, or adventuring folk that still fit in well enough with the world and go on relatively mundane adventures. Levels 5-8 represent elite adventurers who are "movers and shakers" in the world of the game. Levels 9 and up represent characters who can bend reality itself with their awesomeness, and may quest in the realms of gods and other mighty beings. GMs, if you're not sure where to start out your story, we think Level 2 is a good "standard" starting point.</p>
            <p>All characters are assumed to know at least two languages (unless they choose to know fewer). It is recommended that you choose the Common tongue of the setting you will be playing in, and the language that goes with your character's Ancestry (unless Common <em>is</em> the language of your Ancestry, as is true for humans in many settings).</p>
            <h3>2. Strongest Saving Throw</h3>
            <p>Your character gets a free boost in one saving throw: Fortitude, Reflex, or Willpower. This is a +2 bonus, and counts as part of the "base" saving throw, which helps you qualify for special abilities related to that statistic.</p>
            <p>If you're not sure which saving throw to pick here, go with Willpower if you intend to be a spellcaster. Go with Fortitude if you intend to be a warrior who gets hit a lot, and go with Reflex if neither of the other two statements apply.</p>
            <p>If you really want to pick more than one of these, don't fret, you'll eventually be able to improve the ones you didn't pick by picking Talents that boost them, if that's important to you.</p>
            <h3>3. Allocate Ranks in Skills</h3>
            <p>There are ten statistics in Z-Wolf that qualify as Skills: Athletics, Brawn, Charisma, Dexterity, Gadgetry, Glibness, Knowledge, Nature, Perception, and Stealth. The main way you improve these statistics is by putting Ranks into each Skill. Normally, Skills can have no more Ranks than your level, but this rule can be broken by Training a Skill, which gives it two "free" Ranks that don't count towards this limit.</p>
            <p>Choose two of your Skills to Train by default and put two Ranks in each of them. (Special abilities may let you later Train more skills.)</p>
            <p>Then, at each level your character goes through (up to level 8), choose five Skills to put Ranks into. Since you can't exceed your level in any one Skill (or your level +2 if the skill is Trained), you should normally pick five <em>different</em> Skills to put a Rank into at each level. That way you'll never break this limit.</p>
            <p>Some characters like to pick five specialty skills and keep them all at maximum Rank throughout their progression; other characters are more jacks-of-all-trades and spread their Ranks out to more than five Skills.</p>
            <p>On rare occasions, if the character you are building is a Monster, you may have special abilities that Limit your Ranks in a skill. For example, many mundane Beasts have the Charisma, Dexterity, and Knowledge skills Limited. This means the Skill in question is limited to Ranks equal to the character's Heroics Check bonus.</p>
            <h3>4. Select Kits, Feats, and Talents</h3>
            <p>Your character's special abilities are divided into three categories:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Kits</strong> are "packages" of abilities that fit well with each other. They provide your character's unifying themes and archetypes, which makes them the most similar to Classes from other TTRPGs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feats</strong> are your character's "signature moves," usually only useful in combat. A spellcaster's known Spells are one type of Feat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Talents</strong> are lesser abilities; anything that isn't a Kit or a Feat. They have a lot of variety. Some of them round out your character, giving him abilities that represent a life beyond adventuring (which he may or may not have abandoned). Note that Talents are the main way a character continues to progress beyond Level 8, and therefore become a lot more potent at that point.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>PCs may not take special abilities with the [Monster] tag without specific GM approval. The GM should be wary of PCs with these abilities being too powerful in some ways.</p>
            <h4>At Level 1</h4>
            <p>At Level 1, you can select your special abilities in any order. One of your Kits at this level should represent your character's Ancestry (e.g. Dwarf or Elf), unless they are going to be Human. In the Human case, you can either take the Human Paragon Kit, capitalizing on a Human's trademark ambition, or you can take two non-Ancestry Kits to represent a character who has unusually broad areas of study.</p>
            <p>At Level 1, you start with two Kits, one Feat, and four Talents. (The Human Paragon Kit gives you a bonus Feat, and some Kits or Feats give you bonus Talents. Bonus special abilities don't count towards your limits.)</p>
            <h4>At Higher Levels</h4>
            <p>At levels higher than 1, Kits must be selected before Feats, and Feats before Talents, which may affect whether you quality for special abilities' Prerequisites.</p>
            <p>Your character gains a new Kit at Levels 3, 5, 7, and 9. They gain a Feat at each Level, up to Level 8. They gain a new Talent at each level.</p>
            <h4>Help! I'm Paralyzed by Options!</h4>
            <p>Z-Wolf allows for very diverse characters that do a lot of different things. If you're new to the system, this can cause a lot of stressful decision-making that you're not ready for.</p>
            <p>In this case, we recommend you follow the Pre-Built Characters' selections of special abilities. This is similar to having a Class in another TTRPG, dictating what special abilities you receive at each level of progression.</p>
            <h3>5. Choose Complications</h3>
            <p>Your character may be awesome, but they still have weaknesses and flaws in their personality. Including things that may not be thought of at first as flaws or weaknesses, such as a driving motivation or relationships with friends and family.</p>
            <p>At this point, you should list out these weaknesses, as "Complications" on your character sheet. There is no menu of options provided by Z-Wolf to choose from here; you can be as creative as you like and have weaknesses that are as crippling as your heart desires. At the very least, you should pick two Complications, including an overarching motivation for your character (greed? revenge? altruism?).</p>
            <p>Your character, if they are a PC, will have Karma Points that allow them to do cool stuff. The way you gain Karma Points is by running into troubles and tribulations in your adventures, particularly ones that take advantage of your Complications. Each time this happens, you earn a Karma Point. In that sense, Complications actually make your character stronger ... or might, if the Karma Point is worth the additional hassle you run into. The GM should strive to reward Complications that make the game's story more rich and exciting.</p>
            <p>Each PC begins each Adventure with one Karma Point, and can save up a maximum of two Karma Points. Some Kits have "Archetypes," which are ways you can qualify to have your maximum number of Karma Points raised. As long as you don't exceed your character's maximum, you can save up Karma Points for the climax of the Adventure to your heart's content.</p>
            <h3>6. Equip Your Character</h3>
            <p>Ask your GM what kind of equipment and Wealth your character starts out with. The standard is for the GM to name a level of Wealth appropriate to the story, then allow you to buy whatever starting equipment you wish with that Wealth. But the GM has a lot of freedom in this area, includiing the option of giving the characters the Magic Items that they are able to Attune as starting equipment for the campaign.</p>
            <p>Once you have determined your starting equipment, figure out how your character carries it all (e.g. what goes in her Backpack?).</p>
            <h3>7. Update all Statistics on your Character Sheet</h3>
            <p>Your character needs a Name, if you haven't chosen one already in an earlier step.</p>
            <p>All of the following may be modified by your Special Abilities, but their basic formulas are given here:</p>
            <p>Your character's Heroics Check bonus is equal to half their Level, rounded down, to a maximum of +4.</p>
            <p>Your character's base Fortitude Save is equal to your Heroics Check, +2 if you selected it as your Strongest Save in Step 2. If your special abilities give you any additional modifiers to your Fortitude Save, pay close attention to whether they modify your "base" Fortitude (used for various Prerequisites), or just your actual Fortitude die rolls. For example, the Dwarf Kit gains a +2 ancestry bonus to Fortitude saves, but this doesn't help the Dwarf qualify for special abilities that require high Base Fortitude. The Mighty Constitution Talent, on the other hand, does specify that it increases your <em>base</em> Fortitude. These same notes apply to the following Saving Throw statistics.</p>
            <p>Your character's base Reflex Save is equal to your Heroics Check, +2 if you selected it as your Strongest Save in Step 2.</p>
            <p>Your character's base Willpower Save is equal to your Heroics Check, +2 if you selected it as your Strongest Save in Step 2.</p>
            <p>Your character's base Defense Save is equal to your Heroics Check. Wielding a Shield in your equipment arsenal is the most direct means to improve this save.</p>
            <p>Your Vitality Points Pool is equal to twice your character's Level (to a maximum of 16), plus five, plus your <em>base</em> Fortitude Save bonus.</p>
            <p>Your Stamina Points Pool is 4.</p>
            <p>Your Karma Points Pool is 2.</p>
            <p>Your Armor Value is 3. Obviously this can be improved, among other ways, by wearing armor.</p>
            <p>Your Resistance Value is 4, plus either your final Armor Value or your level (up to 8), whichever is greater.</p>
            <p>Your Awesome Check is 4, plus your level (up to 8).</p>
            <p>Your Coast Number is 4.</p>
            <p>Your Fighting Level and your Caster Level are equal to your Heroics Check.</p>
            <p>Your Spellcraft Check is equal to your final Caster Level.</p>
            <p>Your Speed Check is +0.</p>
            <p>Each of your Skills is equal to the number of Ranks placed within it.</p>
            <p>Attacks' Range, Impact, and Peril Trigger are generally determined by the weapon being used for the attack or the special ability that grants the attack to the character. The attack's Accuracy is more dependent on the character's skill, and is equal to 6 + another number: the character's final Fighting Level for weapon attacks; the character's final Caster Level for spell attacks; or the character's Final "Base" Fortitude for vim attacks.</p>
            <p>Your Wealth is equal to ... whatever was left over when you started with the Wealth dictated by the GM and then finished purchasing starting equipment.</p>
            <h4>Synergy Bonuses</h4>
            <p>Having a lot of Ranks in a Skill can give you bonuses to statistics that are tangentially related to that skill, as relayed on the following table.</p>
