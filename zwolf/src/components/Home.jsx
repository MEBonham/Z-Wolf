            <h2>Welcome to Z-Wolf RPG</h2>
            <p>Z-Wolf is an original high-fantasy-adventure Role-Playing Game. Essentially it's how I would re-make <em>Dungeons & Dragons</em> if I were in charge of the universe.</p>
            <p>Z-Wolf is designed to be played using a Virtual Tabletop, such as Foundry VTT. I believe this is the way of the future for many RPG players. Some of the rules, such as the basic die roll and the gridless tactical combat that Z-Wolf is designed around, will be annoyingly clunky without the aid of computer automation provided by a good VTT.</p>
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                
            </ul>
        </>
