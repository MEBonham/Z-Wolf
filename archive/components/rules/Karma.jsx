            <h2>Karma Points</h2>
            <p>Stories are more interesting when they have twists and setbacks, especially when those setbacks are a direct result of the characters' personal weaknesses. To reward you further for having an interesting story in your Z-Wolf game, PCs can earn and spend Karma points.</p>
            <h3>Complication Triggers (Beyond a PC's Complications On Their Sheet)</h3>
            <p>Most things that prod characters to initially go on an adventure can be considered Complications. The GM can consider this to be the reason the PCs start out the Adventure with 1 Karma point, or she can be generous and grant the PCs additional Karma Points when they are motivated to go on an Adventure, especially if their need to adventure is a particularly dickish or personal occurance.</p>
            <p>The extent that a hero's Complications should earn them Karma should be proportional to how much trouble that Complication really causes them. A character who is wheelchair-bound might earn a lot of Karma, but probably not when the PCs aren't really in a hurry and they need to stop and locate a ramp for the wheelchaired character to use. On the other hand, if they <em>are</em> in a hurry and have to find or build a ramp, that's a Complication trigger for sure!</p>
            <p>One Complication trigger that can happen almost as often as the GM likes is to have antagonist NPCs use abilities that would normally require them to spend Karma Points. Since NPCs don't <em>have</em> Karma Points, the way Z-Wolf handles this situation is by having the GM hand out Karma Points equal to those virtually "spent" by NPCs. Normally, these handed out Karma Points go to the PCs most directly impacted by the NPC's special fortune.</p>
            <p>If the GM wishes to give out yet more Karma Points, she can freely introduce other events of bad fortune to the story, especially with the players' agreement. A character who fails a check to climb a cliff, but not badly enough to fall, may fall anyway if the GM introduces it as a Complication Triger and awards a Karma Point for it. A character who is Wounded by a grevious attack might have a more specific injury that will keep affecting them as long as they are still Wounded, leading to potentially many Complication Triggers (and Karma Points) resulting from an injury that is more impactful than the standard rules would dictate.</p>
            <h3>Using Karma Points</h3>
            <h4>Edit Scene</h4>
            <p>A player may spend one of their PC's Karma Points to "edit" the game setting, especially their immediate surroudings, in a way that is convenient for their PC. Discovering just the right piece of mundane equipment in a nearby garbage heap, or having a guard walk by on patrol at just the right moment, or what have you. The GM may veto uses of Edit Scene that are not believable, or counteract the established storyline, or just make the Adventure too easy; in general, the GM has final say over the extent of this ability.</p>
            <h4>Inspiration</h4>
            <p>A player may spend a Karma Point to ask the GM for a hint, a clue, or just generally for some help, especially if they are in the face of some puzzle that they just feel helpless against.</p>
            <h4>Tenacity</h4>
            <p>A player may spend a Karma Point to regain a spent Stamina Point.</p>
            <h4>Improve Saving Throw</h4>
            <p>A player may spend a Karma Point before they roll a Saving Throw. That Saving Throw is then Boosted.</p>
            <h4>Gain Momentum</h4>
            <p>Momentum is its own sub-system, and represents a character being "in the zone" in combat. A variety of special abilities are based on either having Momentum, or expending it.</p>
            <p>A player may spend a Karma Point on their turn in combat to gain Momentum. This does not require an Action.</p>
            <h3>Lifecycle of Karma Points</h3>
            <p>PCs start an Adventure off with 1 Karma Point, and can save up Karma Points until the end of the Adventure, as long as they do not exceed their maximum number of Karma Points.</p>
            <p>A PC's Karma Points Pool statistic (that maximum) is 2, plus how many Archetypes that character has qualified for through their Kits.</p>
